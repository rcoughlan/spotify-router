# OAuth Spotify Bridge

This service is based off of https://github.com/mpj/oauth-bridge-template and lightly refactored to suit the purposes.

It is a backend service to parse a spotify access token to the frontend without displaying the client id or secret to the client. 

## Development mode

In order to start developing, register a Spotify Application here:
https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications

On that page, add http://localhost:8888 as a callback url (don't forget to hit save at the bottom of the page)

Write the below commands in your terminal (replacing XXXX AND YYYY with your acutal client id and secret from the page where you registered your application)

```
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=XXXX
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYY
npm start
```

Then go to http://localhost:8888/login in your browser. This will initiate the login flow and finally redirect to http://localhost:3000?access_token=ZZZZZ where ZZZZZ is a valid access token that you can use to do operations in the Spotify API.
